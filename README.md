A Stealthy Trojan Spyware 🐀

You are looking at a Trojan Virus that steals data (ID, password; every key stroke) from PC (Windows XP or later), then emails them back to you. It spreads among PCs through USB drives, and is almost undetectable to any antivirus software. Created only for learning purpose.

Note: I will not also take any responsibility of someone else's ill act with this program. But I do believe that a real learner will learn a lot from this.
